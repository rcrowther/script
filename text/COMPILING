This library is compiled with SSC. 

== Background
OpenJDK is fine. Most current Java versions are fine.


== Compile with SSC
> ssc compile
> ssc doc


== Compile with the scripts
Run,

> ./make_compile_and_jar
> ./make_docs


== Compile with SBT/Maven etc.
In general, unlike SSC, Java tools expect directories in fixed positions. Either fiddle with the configuration (I think Maven allows this?), or cut and paste the contents of /src into a new folder structure /src/main/scala.

These kinds of tools will need appropriate build file to be written, too.
