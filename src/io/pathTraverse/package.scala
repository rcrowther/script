  * == Path traversal classes ==
  *
  * A set of classes which return a traversable of
  * paths and/or attributes from given directories.
  *
  * The classes feature combinations of source recognition 
  * (e.g. directories only), attribute return, and [[script.io.pathTraverse.TraverseAfterPath]] only visits the directory after visiting the files (good for delete actions).
